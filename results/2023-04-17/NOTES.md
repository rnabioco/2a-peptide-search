flesh out class 2 2A sequence. built initiall HMM from viral Refseq.
Annotated MSA by removing non-conforming sequences, rebuilt HMM.

Searching MGnify, uniparc, and uniprot. merge alignments, inspect.

TODO:

Revisit non-conformant sequences, esp. CIES and NIES forms. Only a few of
these, but worth fleshing out if possible.
