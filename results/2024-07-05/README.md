## DD clade

The class 2 hits seems to have some insertions at key points in the middle (two Asp residues).

1. used Jalview to select out relevant sequences with DD insertions (in `DD-clade`).

2. Build logo and examine

The DD sequences do have one extra Asp residue in the middle of the 2A sequence. Compare:
